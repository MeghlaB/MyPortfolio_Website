                        My programming journey started in college, where I learned the basics of web development with HTML and CSS. I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could transform into a visually appealing web page. As I dived deeper into the world of development, I discovered JavaScript and React, which fueled my passion for creating dynamic, interactive web applications. Since then, Iâ€™ve constantly been honing my skills to build efficient, responsive, and user-centric websites.
